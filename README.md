# Nebula
Nebula is an experimental project focused on building fundamental data structures and algorithms. It serves as a springboard for collaborative learning, research, and development of more complex projects.

# Objectives
Implement basic data structures to establish a common understanding and collaboration workflow.
Gain experience in working with different data structures and algorithms.
Lay the groundwork for future projects involving animated and interactive expositions, and research on interesting topics.

# Current Sprint
Our current sprint focuses on implementing the following data structures:
* Linked List
* Graph
* Heap
* Trees
* Hash maps

# Contributing
Please refer to our  file for guidelines on reporting issues, submitting pull requests, and contributing to the project.

# Testing
We use Pytest for testing our implementations. Tests are organized by data structure in the `tests/` directory.

To run tests:
```bash
pytest
```

To run tests for a specific data structure:
```bash
pytest tests/test_linked_list.py
pytest tests/test_graph.py
```
